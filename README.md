# 0x1D. C - Binary trees 

This directory contains a collection of source code files related to binary trees. This project was developed as a part of our coursework at ALX, where we explore various concepts related to trees, binary trees, tree traversal, and binary search trees.

## Key Concepts

## Tree

In computer science, a tree is a data structure that represents hierarchical relationships between elements. It is composed of nodes connected by edges, where each node can have zero or more child nodes.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a specific type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Tree Traversal

Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting and processing each node in a tree data structure. There are different ways to traverse a tree, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal, each serving various purposes.

## Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree with the property that the value of each node is greater than or equal to all values in its left subtree and less than or equal to all values in its right subtree. This structure is particularly useful for efficient searching and sorting operations.

This project aims to explore and implement various aspects of binary trees, such as creating, traversing, and working with binary search trees, to gain a deeper understanding of these fundamental data structures in computer science.
